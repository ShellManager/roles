# ShellManager Ansible Roles

Hey there! This application is used by the [Provisioning Worker](https://github.com/td512/shellmanager-provision-worker), helping to complete the deployment process, guided by [the ShellManager Configuration Generator](https://github.com/td512/shellmanager-confgen). This worker executes Ansible, and joins the machine to a domain, ready for use

## So what do these playfiles do?

These contain various roles that ShellManager's [Provisioning Worker](https://github.com/td512/shellmanager-provision-worker) uses to provision VMs with software very quickly
